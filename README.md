InQlik Tools for Sublime Text
=============================

##Language plugin for QlikView load scripts


###Syntax Highlighting

* Both block comments (/\* \*/) and line comments (//) are supported. CTRL-/ key combination comment/uncomment code block with line comments (//)
* Variables, built-in functions and so on are trying properly show their boundaries by by coloring corresponding braces.
* Nesting supported for all constructs - variable as parameter of function, function within function, function within variable and so on
* Conflicts between some build-in functions and keywords (IF, LEFT, RIGHT, REPLACE) are resolving by context

####Symbols

In qvs files subroutine names, variables in variable assignment commands and table identifiers marked as symbols. So `Goto Definition`, `Goto Symbol` and `Goto Symbol in Project` commands work.


####Build System

Build system allow to `batch reload` of qvw file from within of corresponding qvs script file opened in Sublime Text. 
To run `batch reload` Sublime Text should be able to find corresponding qvw file.
By default it will look up qvw file with same name as qvs script in same directory. For example: We are editing file `c:\QvProjects\Project1\Apps\LoadData.qvs` in Sublime Text. By invoking build system (keyboard shortcuts for this command are `F7` or `Ctrl-B`) we effectively run shell command 

    c:\Program Files\QlikView\qv.exe /R /NoData c:\QvProjects\Project1\Apps\LoadData.qvw

Load script in your LoadData.qvw file should contain include directive pointing to LoadData.qvs, for example `$(must_include=LoadData.qvs)`  

If qvw file stays in another directory it may be indicated explicitly in first line of qvs script file by shebang-like comment string. For example, if your script file is `c:\QvProjects\Project1\Scripts\LoadData.qvs` corresponding qvd-generator `c:\QvProjects\Project1\Apps\LoadData.qvw` would be found if qvs script has first line

    //#!c:\QvProjects\Project1\Apps\LoadData.qvw

You may also use relative path syntax and skip file part of path string if base names of qvs and qvw file are identical. So in our last example we with same effect may put in first line of qvs script  

    //#!..\Apps

`Ctrl-Shift-B` key combination opens corresponding qlikview application instead of reloading it

####QVD Viewer

Clicking on QVD file in project panel instantly open view with information available in qvd header and LOAD statement for that QVD

####QVW.LOG file viewer

While you editing qvs script file `Ctrl-Shift-L` key combination or menu command `Tools->Packages->InQlik-Tools->Open and refomat qvw.log file` opens qvw.log file corresponding to currently edited script. If you open qvw.log file directly `Ctrl-Shift-L` key combination or menu command just reformat log file.

- Output of qlikview script, including output from TRACE command are formatted as comment
- Input commands are cleared from timestamp info
- Syntax coloring is applied to input commands
- Tables, variables and subroutine definitions are not added to list of defined symbols (Goto definition for example never jump to qvw.log file but to source qvs file)

##Expression Editor: Language plugin for editing QlikView expressions and variables

Expression editor used to write and store QlikView variables in convenient form.
Expression editor use YAML like format.

####Syntax highlighting

Expression editor highlight both syntax for it format and syntax of QlikView expressions edited.

#####Formats of autogenerated file

On every save plugin autogenerate external file in one of available formats:

- Csv variable file in format used by QlikView Deployment Framework (by `LoadVariableCSV` subroutine). That is default option `QDF`.
- Plain qvs script file with LET and SET commands, ready to include in reload script. Option `QVS`
- Csv file in table format (option `CVS`), each row corresponds to whole expression and contains fields
  - Name
  - Definition
  - Label
  - Comment
  - Descirption
  - Section  

Current export format can be changed at menu item  `Preferences->Packages Settings->InQlik-Tools->QlikView variables file settings: User`
#####Mandatory tags:

- LET or SET: precede name of expression. Corresponds to `Variable` field of standard QDF variable csv file 
- Definition: Corresponds to `VariableValue` field.

#####Optional tags:

- Tag (exported as `Priority` field of csv variable file)
- Description (exported as `Comments` field of csv variable file) 

#####Optional tags exported as additional variables in `QDF` format (additional rows in csv variable file)

- label
- comment
- backgroundColor
- fontColor
- nextFormat
- enableCondition
- showCondition
- sortBy
- visualCueUpper
- visualCueLower
- symbol
- thousandSymbol
- villionSymbol
- billionSymbol

Usual minimal expression definition looks like

```
---
set: SalesSum
definition: Sum({<OperationType={Sale}>} Amount)
label: Sales
comment: Sales amount
```
And corresponding auto-generated csv file would be

```
VariableName,VariableValue,Comments,Priority
SET SalesSum,Sum({<OperationType={2}>} Amount),,
SET SalesSum.Comment,Sales amount,,
SET SalesSum.Label,Sales,,
```

####Symbols

In qlikview-vars files expression names (name after `LET` or `SET` tag) marked as symbols. So `Goto Definition`, `Goto Symbol` and `Goto Symbol in Project` commands work for expressions.

####Syntax checks

Minimal syntax checks provided: Checks for mandatory tags, checks for uniqueness of expression names  


## Installation :

### Using [Package Control][1] (*Recommended*)

For all Sublime Text 2/3 users we recommend install via [Package Control][1].

1. [Install][2] Package Control if you haven't yet.
2. Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` then `Package Control: Install Package`
3. Look for `QlikView Tools` and install it.

### Manual Install

1. Click the `Preferences > Browse Packagesâ€¦` menu
2. Browse up a folder and then into the `Installed Packages/` folder
3. Download [zip package][3] rename it to `InQlik-Tools.sublime-package` and copy it into the `Installed Packages/` directory
4. Restart Sublime Text

[Last changes](CHANGELOG.md)

### Compatibility

I've switched to ST3, further development will be focused on that platform.
Basic functionality (syntax highlighting for qvs files and expression files) should work on ST2.
Specifically QVD viewer does not work for ST2 and disabled explicitly in it.
